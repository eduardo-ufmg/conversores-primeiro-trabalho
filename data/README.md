# Data Directory

This directory contains input data, simulation results, and processed outputs.

## Structure

- **input/**: Input data files, measurement data, component parameters
- **output/**: Raw simulation outputs and temporary results
- **results/**: Processed and final simulation results

## File Management

- Keep input data well documented with source information
- Results should be clearly linked to the simulation that generated them
- Use consistent naming conventions for traceability
